3D NOUGHTS AND CROSSES

by T. J.Arnfield

This is the TIC TAC TOE game in 3D on a 4x4x4x4 grid.

The object of the game is to get 4 in a line, through all four grids,
at any angle, or on a single grid, in any row or across the diagonal.
When it's your move, use the arrow keys to move your 'piece' in the
indicated direction,  or the SPACE bar to move it onto the next plane
When you are at the square of your choice,  press the ENTER key for
your move.

Hopefully, all will become clear when you play the game!

These instructions are also contained in the program itself.

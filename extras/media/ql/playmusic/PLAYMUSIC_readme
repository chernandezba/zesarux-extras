Type:     sound/beep


Demonstrates the musical capabilities of the BEEP command.

The music is stored in DATA statements at the end of the program.

The DATA follows the following format:

  firstly:
    DATA title(string),author(string),tempo(float)

  then:
    DATA note(string),dur(int),note(string),dur(int),etc.

The lowest note is "F 1" and the highest is "B 4".
Middle C is "C 4". Notes follow the order C,D,E,F,G,A,B etc.
Use # symbol to define sharp notes, i.e. "F#1", "G#2" etc.


The program makes use of the fact that the command:

 BEEP <pitch>,<dur>

gives a frequency approximately equal to 11447/(10.6+<pitch>) hz
and a duration of <dur>*72/1000000 seconds

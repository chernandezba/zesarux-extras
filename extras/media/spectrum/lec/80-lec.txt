                        80-LEC.ROM INFO FILE
                        --------------------

This is yet another ROM file, the source of it is unknown to me, but this is a
list of features, discovered using the disasembler.

1) Startup menu

After startup, a menu appears, with following options:

- BASIC :   Enter the basic
- MONITOR : Enter the monitor (see below)
- BOOT :    Load and run 'run' file from the microdrive

2) Detokenized keyboard

This ROM has detokenized keyboard input. The tokenizer routine is good:
keywords may be entered both in capitals and lower letters, and a space between
GO and TO in GO TO command (or GO SUB, DEF FN etc.) is not necessary. Space is
not necessary after a command (so, PRINT1 is acceptable), except when the
argument begin with letter (e.g, PRINTA is not acceptable).

If you prefer tokenized keybord, you can turn detokenized keybord input off
using basic command:

FORMAT "k"

The same command given again will turn on tokenized input again. This is
controled via bit 7 in FLAGS2 (address 23658).

3) Extended editor

During editing a long line, it is possible to move cursor up and down.

4) 80 K support

This ROM has extended BASIC co ed Spectrum expanded to
80 K (see below). I don't know which is producer of supported expansion, but it
seems that it is not the most usual 80 K expansion, in which upper 32 K of RAM
is paged. Namely, in according to ROM dissasembly, it seems that in this
expansion FIRST 32 K is paged (address 0-32767) using bit 7 of port 253, with
following meaning:

b0=0 : standard configuration (0-16383 ROM, 16384-32767 standard RAM)
b0=1 : 0-32767 extra 32K RAM

If somebody wants to change used port, and wants support for standard 80K
paging, I will support necessary infos via E-mail.

5) Extra BASIC commands:

This ROM has 4 new BASIC commands (more precise, a new meaning of existing
ones):

CAT
---

CAT without parameters enter the monitor, else works as usual.

FORMAT
------

FORMAT "k" turns on or off tokenized keyboard; other forms of FORMAT work as
usual.

ERASE
-----

ERASE "i" erases extra Interface 1 variables, extended channels etc. without
affecting the BASIC program in memory; other forms of ERASE work as usual.

MOVE
----

This is the most complex extra command, with the following syntax:

MOVE "<src_code><src_addr>,<src_len>","<dest_code><dest_addr>"

This will move <src_len> bytes from <src_addr> to <dest_addr>. <src_code> and
<dest_code> may be "r" with meaning "standard ROM/RAM" and "d" with meaning
"extra 32K RAM". Try for example (on the emulator):

MOVE "r0,6144","r16384"

An expressions are allowed between quotes. Other forms of MOVE works as usual.
This syntax seems strange (parameters as part of a string), but obviously
author wants to preserve original syntax of MOVE <string>,<string>.

6) Monitor

The monitor has following commands (all parameters except for command H are
hex numbers):

B             Warm exit to BASIC (if possible)

D<hex_num>    Displays entered hex number in decimal notation

G<addr>       Execute a subroutine at address G (RET will return to the
              monitor).

H<dec_num>    Displays entered decimal number in hex notation

M<addr>       Hex and ASCII dump from given address (space for exit).

R             View and/or change registers AF, BC, DE, HL, IX and SP.

S<addr>       Patch memory from given address using hex editor (enter just
              space to exit hex editor).

7) A new interupt routine

The standard interrupt routine is changed, so pressing SYMBOL SHIFT, SPACE and
B simultaneously will enter the monitor (except when interrupts are disabled,
or when IM 2 mode is used without calling RST 56). Also, NMI bug is corrected
(NMI is redirected via NMIADD if <>0).

8) Other changes

- Changed startup parameters (black-on-white screen, keyboard click, autorepeat
  speed).

- A new screen font.

- Corrected CHR$ 8 and CHR$ 9 bug.

- Corrected WAIT_KEY bug during displaying of "scroll?" message, etc.

- Corrected CLOSE bug (crash on CLOSE #4 without Interface 1 if stream 4 is not
  open).

- Shorter delay between header and block during saving.

That's all. If somebody wants extra infos, E-mail me at address:

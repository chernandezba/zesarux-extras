This is an hybrid Collection, presenting 3 elements:
 - The DOS based ACE32 emulator for imediate trial, under DosBox (OS free).
 - The ACE ROM Documentation Project, after several versions not published.
 - The ROM patch restoring a few of FORTH ACE non-inclusions due (whatever).

Last mentioned, not the least, the Patched ROM restores the ACE in 3 ways.
It is distributed under GPL-3 terms (expressed in GPL3.txt).

1 - It restores CODE word 
    This used to build Primary Words (as well as restoring the missing)
2 - It replaces OVER word
    OVER is a stack operator, a Primary word unfortunately turned Secondary
3 - A few hacks on some hidden Secondaries 
    Some words used in arithmetic need to be (code) Primaries. (30% faster)

  ( For a fast tryout of SIEVE, under ACE32, press F5.      )
  ( Or you may load the SPOOL.txt as keyb input, using F9.  )
  ( Or even rename SPOOL, to rename and use the other one.  ) 

What can we say? Change [2] demanded 3 bytes, could be done in hours.
Not the case after the fact, we needed to get some space (40 years later).

In the last 3 months, after years studying Both FORTH and the ACE, we
manage to do what has been considered "impossible" (always a teaser).
Naturally, we had time. Not all these years...free from shedules.

In honnour of a dream, that could: The ACE
___
P.S. Beyond the importance of the ACE to me, thus honnouring it,
     The ACE, its real history hidden in code, the environment
     of people using it hints... to me is mirror of the world.
     A lesson, of opportunities lost and more (not to say).

     I may be suspicious saying this, as Conways "LIFE" was
     an hint to much more, unspeakable. A lesson too!
     ... So may you, looking (without prejudice).

     Ha! Yes, FORTH is much more than just a Language.

* Games reseting or bad behaviour due to the "Inves write-on-interrupt bug". Overwrite address (I*256+R) with 255.
It overwrites the interrupt table, when R<128 (on cold reset) there's no danger because the interrupt vector are in the two last bytes of the table,
and having R<128, only the first 128 bytes are overwritten.
But if the game changes R to be >=128, the last two bytes will be overwritten soon: if they have 255 value, no problem. But if not, they will be overwritten with 255 and the game will crash or hang

        512KB of nonvolatile RAM and 512KB of FLASHROM. They can be
        "PAGED-IN" in 16KBytes blocks on address space 0 - $3FFF. This
        is the only region that allows such a feature, as the "ROMCS"
        signal provided on the Edge Connector can be used to disable the
        internal ZX-Spectrum ROM and avoid any conflict. This makes the

        tell it right, this interface was designed just for this
        purpose.</font></p>
    <p><b><font color="#ffffff" face="Tahoma" size="2">The PAGING
          Control Register:</font></b></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2">This RD/WR register,
        built into the CPLD, works exactly as on the ZX-Badaloc clone.
        The I/O address on ZXMMC+ is $7F and it's bit layout is as
        follows:</font></p>

    <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2">D7: This is a
        stand-alone bit. When SET, the RAM Chip is WRITE ENABLED, no
        matter what is enabled on READ. For example, a simple BASIC
        program may copy the Sinclair ROM to one RAM bank by just
        setting this bit then performing a FOR/NEXT loop which POKEs
        back what is read by PEEK on the 0 - 16383 address space. The
        PEEK will read the Sinclair ROM, while the POKE will write in
        RAM. When the loop completes, the RAM can be enabled in READ
        mode in place of the internal ROM. Being a separate bit, D7
        allows write-only operation as well as write protection, turning
        the nonvolatile RAM into some kind of fast ROM. This is the key
        feature used by ResiDOS to work. NOTE: Sinclair basic uses to
        alter a few locations of the "ROM", if the zxmmc+ ram is left
        write-enabled. If the above basic example is tried, it is
        advisable to write-protect the ram bank prior to returning to
        the basic "prompt" (i.e. by including the OUT instruction in the
        command, after a colon).</font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2">D6: When SET, this
        bit activates the PAGE IN on READ cycles. The internal ROM is
        disabled and one bank from RAM or ROM is accessed instead.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2">D5: When LOW, the RAM
        chip is selected for PAGE IN function. When HIGH, the ROM
        (FLASH) is selected.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2">D4:D0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


        These 5 bits are used to select one of 32 banks, 16KB each, from
        RAM or ROM (depending on D5). Their state directly affects the
        logic level on the 5 upper address lines of bot the RAM and
        FLASH chips, who are provided by the CPLD.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2">The power-on status
        of D5 and D6 is user-selectable by means of dip switch n. 3 and
        4 respectively. When PAGING is OFF, the internal ROM will show
        up when the system is powered or reset. If RAM paging is enabled
        and ResiDOS was previously installed into nonvolatile ram, then
        ResiDOS will start on power-on. If ROM paging is enabled, then
        ROM BANK 0 will be selected at power-on.</font></p>

          the OUT $7FFD instruction and captures data bit D4 to the
          lower address line of the bank page. </b>This means that a
        complete 128K Spectrum ROM SET can be programmed and will work
        in flashrom, enabling the creation of NMI-patched rom for
        snapshot purposes. This feature is disabled when zxmmc+ RAM is
        paged-in, to avoid problems when running ResiDOS or bootrom
        firmware.</font></p>

    <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2">The interface
        provides two SD/MMC card slots, accessible through an hardware
        SPI port built into the CPLD. This port is capable of
        transferring one byte in 16T-states, so the 21T-states INIR/OTIR
        or even a 16T-states INI/OUTI "unrolling" instruction sequence
        (proposed by Paolo Ferraris) can be used. This means that,
        beside header overhead, reading a block of data from the card is
        as fast as transferring it from memory to memory. Write can be
        somehow slower, because the SD card needs time to physically
        "program" the internal flash memory array and will respond as
        "busy" in the meantime. Further details on the SPI port can be
        found in the <a href="../index.html"><font

        $1F. The Kempston Joystick can be enabled/disabled by means of
        Dip Switch n.1. Due to a lack of free pins on the CPLD, two
        joystick data lines are shared with two of the 5-bit BANK
        Address for RAM and ROM bank selection. As can be seen in the
        schematic, Kempston D4 and D5 are placed on MSB_A17 and MSB_A18
        respectively, through a resistor. When memory is accessed by the
        processor, these two CPLD pins are turned into Outputs and the
        complete 5-bit MSB address is formed on RAM/ROM address bus. In
        all other cases, the pins work as Inputs so that reading the
        Kempston port will give the expected result.</font></p>

    <p style="color: rgb(51, 204, 255);" align="left"><b><font
          face="Tahoma" size="4">IF 1 FEATURES:</font></b></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2">The zxmmc+ implements
        a RS-232 and a Network port that works like those on the
        Sinclair INTERFACE 1, with a few exceptions. These peripherals
        can be enabled/disabled by means of dip-switch n. 2.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2">Both the RS-232 and
        NetWork interfaces has been successfully tested. The IF1's
        Shadow ROM can be programmed into ZXmmc+ flash memory, turning
        the machine into a real IF1-equipped system under any point of
        view, except microdrives.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2">Due to PCB size
        constraints, RS-232 and Network connections end up on a single
        6-pin strip connector. It's pinout is as follows:</font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2">PIN
        1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NET<br>
        PIN 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RXDATA (output)<br>
        PIN 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TXDATA (input)<br>
        PIN 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DTR (input)<br>
        PIN 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GND<br>
        PIN 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CTS (output)</font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2">With the exception of
        PIN 1, this can be straight pin-to-pin connected to a female
        DB-9 to be directly plugged into an IBM-PC 9 pin serial port. It
        should however be noted that the CTS input on ibm-pc is pin 8
        and not 6; a straight connection is still possible as pin 6 is
        DSR (which is an input as well).</font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2">The IF1 NetWork
        signal goes to pin 1; this could be wired to a 3.5mm male jack
        to be plugged into the NET socket of a real IF1 interface (which
        of course should be plugged on another ZX-Spectrum). An on-board
        330 ohm termination resistor is provided (and can be disabled by
        removing a jumper, in case the zxmmc+ is not at one end of the
        network).</font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2">As on the original
        hardware, I/O Addresses involved in RS-232 and Network
        communication are $EF and $F7. However, in order to simplify the
        internal CPLD logic and thanks to the fact that there are no
        data bits with different meaning at same position on these two
        ports, both $EF and $F7 returns the same data when read, as
        follows:</font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2">D7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        TXDATA status (rs-232 data input) (in the original IF1, this is
        on port $F7 only)<br>
        D3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DTR status (rs-232 DTR input) (in the
        original IF1, this is on port $EF only)<br>
        D0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NET status (Network) (in the original IF1,
        this is on port $F7 only, while on $EF this is the zx-microdrive
        write protect bit)</font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2">All remaining bits
        will read '0'.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2">On write access,
        these two ports will behave in different way. Supported bits are
        as follows:</font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2">$F7
        D0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NET Output / RXDATA (Network output or
        rs-232 data output, depending on $EF D0 state)<br>
        $EF D5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WAIT: when '0', this bit will LOCK THE
        PROCESSOR in WAIT STATE, if the NET line is active (+5V). Wait
        state will cease as soon as NET is resting.<br>
        $EF D4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CTS Output<br>
        $EF D0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMMS_OUT: When LOW, net/rxdata ($F7
        D0) out goes to NET; when HIGH, net/rxdata goes to RS-232</font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2">A nonstandard feature
        of the RS-232 port is the capability to generate an NMI when a
        Start Bit is detected. This is disabled by default and can be
        activated by setting bit D3 on $1F port, described in the "mass
        storage" section. This feature allows an NMI handler to
        establish serial a communication, no matter what the Spectrum is
        doing, when requested by a remote device. This is how the
        provided "bootrom" firmware performs RS232-based screenshots and
        snapshots on a running ZX-Spectrum. The NMI handler should
        immediately disable further NMI calls by resetting bit D3 on $1F
        port, to avoid nested execution on each rising edge of the
        RS-232 input line. The feature should then be re-enable just
        before quitting (the firmware takes care of all this).<br>

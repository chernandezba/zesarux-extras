      Work in TR-Dos from command line and from Basic.

TR-Dos  line  commands  use  BASIC syntax (TR-Dos calls BASIC
line editor) and are like BASIC commands for work with tape.
The common syntax:

       command [ <file> [,<file>] ]

where <file> = "[d:]filename" <type> [<attrs>]
       d: - drive,
       "filename" - BASIC string (any 8 symbols)
       <type> - one of following types supported by TR-Dos:
            <nothing> - Basic program;
            CODE - code block;
            DATA - numeric or symbol array;
            # - random access file.
       <attrs> include start and ,maybe, length of block for
            CODE, array name for DATA, another stuff for
            specific commands.
Any  strings  or  numbers  in command can be replaced by BASIC
variables.Example:



 Commands:

*"d" -choose drive d: (A, B, C, D);

CAT [#channel] - output disk catalog in brief format into the
channel.

LIST [#channel] - output catalog in detailed format.

LOAD <file>    \
SAVE <file>     |  the same as BASIC commands
MERGE <file>    |
VERIFY <file>  /

RUN  <file>  - load BASIC or CODE file and run it (code files
executing  from  start  address).When  file  is not specified,
TR-Dos  runs  the  file  "boot" (it executes also after TR-Dos
restart).
Example: RUN "mons4b" CODE 30000

GOTO <file> -load and execute file containing memory copy
made with Magic Button. If filename starts with $, IM 2 is set
before running.

ERASE <file> - delete file from disk

MOVE  -  remove deleted files from disk. When deleted file is
situated  in  the  middle  of the disk, sectors occupied by it
cannot be overwritten. This command removes that blanks.

FORMAT  "[$]label"  - format disk. Label can be as long as 11
symbols, but most of utilities show 8 of them. If $ is at the
beginning of the label, disk is formatted as single-sided one.

NEW "newname",<file> -rename file.
Example: NEW "File 1","file1"CODE

COPY [s][b] <file1>, <file2> - copy file1 to file2. "s" mode
is  for  machines  with  one  drive (pause for disk change is
made), when "b" is set, the whole disk is copied.
Example:    COPY "A:News"CODE,"C:archive"

PEEK "filename" Addr,Sec - read sector from specified file
into memory from start address Addr.

POKE "filename" Addr, Sec -write sector into file.

OPEN #stream,"filename"[r|w] - open file for read or write.
Basic stream is opened, and Basic program can access it with
operators PRINT #stream;<string>, INPUT #stream;s$
and INKEY$ #stream.

OPEN  #stream,"filename"RND,Rec_size  -  open file for random
access with specified record size.

CLOSE #stream - close previously opened file.

All  these  commands  can  be  executed from BASIC program by
adding them to the following prefix:

       RANDOMIZE USR 15619:REM:

or, if you need the error code,

       LET a=USR 15619:REM:
       PRINT USR 15619:REM:

etc.
15619  is  an  entry  point  for  TR-Dos command processor. It
requires  the  command string address to be specified in Basic
system  variable CH_ADD (23645/46) and can be called both from
BASIC and Assembler. It returns an error code in BC:
0 - OK
1 - No file
2 - File exists
3 - No space, Out of RAM
4 - Directory full
5 - Rec O/F
6 - No disk
10- Stream opened
11- Not disk file
12- *ERROR*
13- Verify error
14- Array not found
...

BASIC program example:

10 RANDOMIZE USR 15619:REM:CAT
20 INPUT "File to open: ";f$
30 LET a=USR 15619:REM:OPEN #4,f$,R
40 IF a=1 THEN PRINT "NO FILE!":STOP
50 INPUT #4;A$:PRINT A$
...
100 RANDOMIZE USR 15619:REM:CLOSE #4
120 RANDOMIZE USR 15616


RANDOMIZE USR 15616 - TR-Dos command line call.

Other entry points:
15649 - initialize
15635 - system functions call
102 (NMI)- Magic Button routine
I'll describe them later.

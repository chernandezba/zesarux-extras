  1.Internal Tr-Dos functions
 -----------------------------

  To have access to desired Tr-Dos function you have to load  C  register with
 function number, load other used registers with necessary data ( see function
 description ) and do CALL #3D13.

 #00 - Interface initialization. This  resets  FDC  chip  ( WD1793 in original
       Beta 128 Disk interface, KR1818WG93  in Soviet  clone of  Beta 128 Disk
       interface ), moves drive heads to physical 00 track and waits for INTRQ
       signal. BREAK key pressing is also checked.

 #01 - Disk drive initialisation. Drive  number must  be loaded to A register.
       If  DOS variable in  range  23802...23805  for  defined  drive  is  not
       initialized  yet ( equal  to #FF ) then it will be  set  to  #08. After
       that  DOS set  some variables. 23752...23755:  #00 for 40 track or  #80
       for 80 track drives. Then  number of drive  from  A  register  will  be
       written to 23798 ( current drive number ), and to  the  23830  will  be
       saved copy of system register.

 #02 - Seek track. Track number must be loaded to A register ( in range 0-179,
       i.e. 1-st  physical track  has 0 and 1 logical track numbers - 0 bottom
       side, 1 top side ).

 #03 - Set sector  number. Sector number  should be  loaded to  the A register
       ( 1-16 ) - this number will be written to 23807 DOS variable.

 #04 - Define buffer address. Buffer address must be loaded to the HL register
       pair. This writes HL contents to 23808 DOS variable.

 #05 - Read group of sectors. In HL must be  loaded address where  sector data
       should  be readed, B must be  loaded with  number of sectors to read, D
       must be loaded  with track number and E with sector number. If B loaded
       with  #00 then interface will only read sector address mark - useful if
       you only want check is there sector with defined number on the track.

 #06 - Write group of sectors. Everything same  as for  #05  function,  except
       B=#00 of course ;)

 #07 - Send  disk catalogue to the stream. Stream number must be loaded to the
       A  register ( 2-screen, 3-printer ). Disk  number will  be  taken  from
       ( 23798 ) DOS variable. You  have to write  contents  of 23798 to 23800
       and 23801 variables too. Function #18 will  be automatically  executed.

 #08 - Read file descriptor to DOS  variable  area. This read  file descriptor
       ( #0F bytes ) with  number from A ( from 0 to 127 include  deleted ) to
       #5CDD-#5CEC address.

 #09 - Write file descriptor from DOS variable area to disk. This  will  write
       file  descriptor ( #0F bytes ) starting  from #5CDD address to the disk
       catalogue.  Number  of  descriptor  to  replace  must  be  loaded  in A
       register.

 #0A - Find file. File name and file type must  be specified  in DOS variables
       #5CDD-#5CE5, number  of bytes  to check must  be  written to  23814. If
       file  found  then C  register,  #5D1E  and  #5D0F  DOS  variables  will
       contain number  of file  descriptor. If no file found the in C register
       will be #FF.
 
 #0B - Save CODE file to disk. Address must be loaded to HL registers pair and
       length must be loaded to DE register pair. Name  and type must  already
       be  in #5CDD address. No  checking for existing file will be done. Also
       function #18 executed automatically.

 #0C - Save BASIC  program to  disk. File name  must  already be  in #5DCC. At
       #5CD1 must be specified number of BASIC auto-start line.

 #0D - Exit from Tr-Dos ( reserved ).

 #0E - Load or Verify. File descriptor  must already be  in  #5DCC. Write  #00
       to  #5CF9 if you want Load  or #FF if you want Verify file. For loading
       BASIC  program  #5D10 must  have  #00! If there will  be  #FF then  old
       BASIC program will  be  removed  but  new  one  would  not  be  readed.
       According to contents of  A  register this  function  acts in different
       ways:

        A=#00 - take address and length from disk catalogue;
        A=#03 - take address in HL length in DE;
        A=#FF - take address in HL but length taken from disk catalogue;

 #0F - Exit from Tr-Dos ( reserved ).

 #10 - Exit from Tr-Dos ( reserved ).

 #11 - Exit from Tr-Dos ( reserved ).

 #12 - Delete file. Name  and file type  must be  specified in  #5CDD address.
       Please note that ALL files  with such attributes  will be  deleted from
       disk. In  #5D08 will be saved first symbol of name of last deleted file
       and  first symbol of file name on disk will be changed to #01 ( deleted
       file mark ).

 #13 - Copy data to file descriptor area. This function copies #0F  bytes from
       address in HL to #5CDD.

 #14 - Copy file descriptor information.  This function copies file descriptor
       information ( #0F bytes ) from #5CDD to address in HL register.

 #15 - Test track. This function reads whole track which number must be loaded
       to the D register. If  there was  any errors  then  DOS  variable #5D0F
       will  contain "7" error  code and  in  variable  #5CD6  number  of  bad
       sectors.

 #16 - Select  bottom  disk  side. This  changes  "disk side"  bit  in  system
       register to '0'.

 #17 - Select  top disk side. This changes "disk side" bit in  system register
       to '1'.

 #18 - Read system track from disk. This will try read 9th logical sector from
       disk and set DOS system variables.
